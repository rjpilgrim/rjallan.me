This is the code for my personal website.

There are three primary subfolders:

myServer: Builds a binary which runs on a Linux machine at my house to fetch samples from a LimeSDR or hackRF, process them, and send them off to the website.

flutterSite: Builds a flutter app which runs on the client.

cloudServer: Builds a binary intended to be run in cloud which performs simple fft operation on a web audio stream.

Subfolders include their own instructions.
